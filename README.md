## Description of project:

A full-stack web application designed to help beginner lifters—especially college students—transition into more structured, intermediate-level training. This app aims to offer a clean, easy-to-use workout tracker built specifically for users who want a simple tool to log workouts and visualize progress over time.

## Purpose and Scope:

I believe many beginner-to-intermediate lifters struggle to track their gym progress in a meaningful, motivating way. Existing apps are often cluttered, hard to use, or locked behind subscriptions. This app provides a clean, simple workout tracker focused on helping users transition from casual workouts to serious strength training.

## Functions and Features of Website:

- Register, sign in, and log out a user.
- User can view, add, update, and delete workout plans and exercises.
- User can activate and deactivate their selected workout plan.
- The system displays the day’s exercises.
- User can start a workout and input their effort per exercise.
- Tracks user progress and display it through charts.
